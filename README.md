# suppi - what'S UP PI?

*Yes, it's clearly a Bugs Bunny reference*

> Suppi is still not ready but as the winter is around the corner I'm rushing to finish it as soon as possible.

Suppi is my weekend Raspberry Pi project for monitoring some of my sensors at my home.

## Some thoughts

### Why not Home Assistant?

Home Assistant is gigantic home automation project, while Suppi is just trying to monitor things.
Also, I'm not trying to beat HA here or something. I just wanted to keep the whole thing simple, small and know exactly
how everything works. It's a good exercise too.
